# 🎯 Full-Featured Demo Solution

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The compilation error occurs because webpack tries to compile ALL files in the `src` directory, including production files with AWS dependencies (`AuthContext.js` and `SharedDataContext.js`), even when running in demo mode.

## ✅ **Solution: Isolated Demo Script**

I've created a script that temporarily hides the problematic production files during demo compilation:

```bash
./scripts/run-demo-isolated.sh
```

## 🎯 **What This Gives You**

- ✅ **Barcode Scanning Simulation** - Process transactions
