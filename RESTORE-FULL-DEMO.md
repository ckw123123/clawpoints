# 🔄 Restoring Full-Featured Demo

You're absolutely right! I apologize for simplifying the demo. Let me restore the **original full-featured demo** with all the capabilities we built:

## ✅ **Original Features to Restore:**

### **🔐 Role-Based Access Control**
- Admin (Super User/Shop Owner): Full access to everything
- Sales User: Can manage members, prizes, items but NOT users or settings  
- Member: Regular user with limited access

### **👥 User Management (Admin Only)**
- Add Users: Create new Sales or Admin users
- Edit Users: Modify user details and roles
- Delete Users: Remove Sales users (Admin cannot be deleted)
- Role Management: Assign Admin or Sales roles

### **🎯 Enhanced Member Management (Admin & Sales)**
- Search Members: Search by name or username
- Show All: Display all members (10 max) with toggle button
- Full CRUD: View, Edit, Delete member functionality
- Member Details: Shows points, email, contact info

### **🎁 Prize & Item Management**
- Complete inventory control
- Barcode scanning simulation
- Stock management
- Point value configuration

### **📊 Transaction Processing**
- Barcode recognition
- Point earning and redemption
- Transaction history
- Member point updates

### **🌐 Multi-Language Support**
- English/Chinese toggle
- All interface elements translated
- Language preference saved

## 🔧 **The Issue**

The compilation errors were caused by:
1. Missing `canManageUsers` variable definition
2. Some components importing production contexts with AWS dependencies
3. Duplicate keys in LanguageContext

## 🎯 **Solution**

I need to:
1. ✅ Fix the undefined variables in AdminDashboard-demo
2. ✅ Ensure all demo components use demo contexts only
3. ✅ Keep ALL the original functionality intact
4. ✅ Just fix the compilation issues

## 🚀 **Goal**

Restore the **complete demo** that includes:
- Full admin dashboard with tabs
- User management interface
- Member management with search
- Prize and item management
- Barcode scanning simulation
- Transaction processing
- Multi-language support
- All the features we originally built!

**The demo should be exactly like the original, just without compilation errors.**
