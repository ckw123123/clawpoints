- **🔒 SSL/HTTPS**: Automatic SSL certificate and secure connections
- **📊 Monitoring**: Real-time analytics and error tracking
- **💰 Cost-Effective**: ~$0.12/month for demo hosting
- **⚡ Fast Loading**: Optimized caching and compression

## 🚀 Quick Deployment (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install AWS CLI
brew install awscli  # macOS
# or
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"  # Linux

# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure

# Install jq for JSON processing
brew install jq  # macOS
# or
sudo apt-get install jq  # Ubuntu
```

### Option 1: Simple Deployment
```bash
# Deploy with basic S3 + CloudFront setup
./scripts/deploy-aws-demo.sh
```

### Option 2: Professional Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Deploy with CloudFormation infrastructure
./scripts/deploy-aws-demo-pro.sh

# Optional: Add custom domain
./scripts/deploy-aws-demo-pro.sh --domain demo.yourcompany.com --certificate arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```

### Option 3: With Monitoring
```bash
# Deploy + setup monitoring dashboard
./scripts/deploy-aws-demo-pro.sh
./scripts/setup-demo-monitoring.sh
```

## 🌐 Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

### Step 1: Request SSL Certificate
```bash
# Request certificate in us-east-1 (required for CloudFront)
aws acm request-certificate \
    --domain-name demo.yourcompany.com \
    --validation-method DNS \
    --region us-east-1
```

### Step 2: Validate Certificate
1. Go to AWS Certificate Manager console
2. Add DNS validation records to your domain
3. Wait for validation (5-30 minutes)

### Step 3: Deploy with Custom Domain
```bash
# Get certificate ARN from ACM console
CERT_ARN="arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"

# Deploy with custom domain
./scripts/deploy-aws-demo-pro.sh \
    --domain demo.yourcompany.com \
    --certificate $CERT_ARN
```

### Step 4: Update DNS
Add CNAME record pointing to CloudFront distribution:
```
demo.yourcompany.com → d1234567890123.cloudfront.net
```
